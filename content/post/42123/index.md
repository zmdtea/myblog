Everytime you turn right, you must also look at your left side.

## Part I

{{< expandable label="Where it starts..." level="2" >}}
Sometimes, it's as if everything I had fades away, leaving me with nothing. Out of nowhere, a wave of profound sadness crashes over me, engulfing my entire being. It's like a relentless wormhole of negativity that I can't escape from. My mind feels clouded, unable to focus on anything else but the overwhelming sorrow that permeates my being.

I desperately want it to stop, to understand why I'm feeling this way, but I'm at a loss. I'm unable to pinpoint the cause of this emotional onslaught. Slowly, memories of painful moments from my past flood my mind, adding to the weight of my sorrow. It's as if I'm drowning in the middle of a pitch-black ocean with no sight of a lifeboat to rescue me.

**Have you ever experienced something like this?**

## Part II

{{< expandable label="A simple solution..." level="2" >}}
You know what? It's completely normal to experience moments when our brain and emotions seem complicated and hard to understand. We're human beings with intricate emotional landscapes that can sometimes leave us feeling lost. It's natural to wonder if what we're feeling is depression, a flashback, or a result of low self-esteem. The truth is, these emotions arise because we're human and we have feelings.

When these moments occur, one simple solution is to take a step back, reflect, and allow ourselves to truly feel. It's important to dive deep into our emotions, explore our past experiences, and fully embrace every feeling that our brain is trying to communicate. It's a reminder to stop hiding from our inner selves and to stop ignoring our emotions.

True healing comes when we can transform these experiences into memories that no longer evoke intense emotions, but instead serve as lessons for us to learn from our own past. It's about embracing these moments as part of our growth journey and allowing them to shape us into better versions of ourselves. **So, take the time to feel, reflect, and learn from your own past, and you'll find that you're on the path to healing and self-discovery.**

## Part III

{{< expandable label="Encouragements and suggestions..." level="2" >}}
I urge everyone to prioritize regular self-care breaks. Your well-being is crucial for your productivity and ability to support others. When you're feeling depleted at 50% health, a task may take 8 hours to complete, but when you're operating at 100%, it might only take 4 hours. Take time to reflect and understand your emotions, thoughts, and needs. It's unrealistic to expect others to read your mind and fulfill your internal desires if you haven't even grasped 80% of your own being. **So brighten up, you are not alone and take one step at a time!**
